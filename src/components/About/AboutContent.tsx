        Hello everyone! I'm Stefania, a passionate 33-year-old woman who has
        turned the world of front-end development into her own creative
        playground. Immersed in the realm of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, my goal
        is to turn lines of code into user experiences that leave a mark. For
        example, I created this portfolio using React with TypeScript to hone
        these skills. I'm up for any challenge!
      </p>
      <p>
        With a keen eye for design, I've spent time shaping the visual aspect of
        Twitch and websites, bringing my passion for graphic design into every
        project. Creating intuitive and captivating interfaces is my specialty,
        and I like to think of myself as bringing the visual side of the web to
        life. But that's not all! Besides my digital world, there's a piece of
        my heart in video games. A dedicated lover of J-RPGs, I dive into
        adventures with the same dedication I tackle a new coding challenge. My
        collection of trophies and achievements is a tangible sign of my
        determination to conquer virtual worlds. üí™üèªüéÆ Currently, I've just
        finished refining my skills in the world of front-end web development at
        the ITS Steve Jobs Academy in Catania, an experience that adds a local
        touch to my professional growth, so I'm totally #opentowork!
      </p>
      <p>
        I am a determined, hardworking, proactive person, and a quick learner. I
        have intermediate proficiency in writing and speaking English and
        advanced proficiency in reading. I am ready to bring my fresh academic
        skills to your team, contributing with fresh ideas and a dynamic
        approach to creating engaging interfaces. Join me in this digital
        adventure, where code becomes art and user experience takes center
        stage!
